# examples

in this directory I shall provide some examples of brainfuck code you can run. 

Of course they are very basic and simple as I am no mad brainfuckist but you can check the following bf code made by others:

* [ascii Mandelbrot set fractal](https://github.com/erikdubbelboer/brainfuck-jit/blob/master/mandelbrot.bf) by Erik Dubbelboer
* [Conways Game of Life](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/brainfuck/) written in brainfuck by Linus Akesson (this one is really impressive)

Oh and you can see my usage of special additional commands (`!^`) in the `power.bf` (`pn_obf.bf` is the same).

But you can see the program for raising numbers to a power in `p_obf.bf` too
